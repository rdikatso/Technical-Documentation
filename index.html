                    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language used worldwide. 
                    Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for 
                    small and large-scale projects.</p>
                    <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
                    structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described 
                    as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library</p>
                    <p>Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more (and in the 
                    past supported many more). A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source 
                    reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for 
                    Python and CPython development.</p>

                    <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are 
                    fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including 
                    by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)).Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design 
                    by contract and logic programming.</p>
                    <p>Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for 
                    memory management.It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during 
                    program execution.</p>
                    <p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document <q><i>The Zen of Python (PEP 20)</i></q>, which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
                        <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                        <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                        <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                        <li>Readability counts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English 
                    keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit 
                    blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.</p>
                    <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation 
                    comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.Thus, the program's visual 
                    structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which 
                    some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.</p>

                    <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,provides tools suited to many 
                    tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. 
                    It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom 
                    numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
                    <p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation 
                    follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, 
                    because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant 
                    implementations.</p>
                    <p>As of November 2019, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, 
                    contains over 200,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automation</li>
                        <li>Data Analytics</li>

                    <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a 
                    command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.</p>
                    <p>Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state 
                    retention and syntax highlighting.</p>
                    <p>As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath 
                    (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting 
                    environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.</p>

                    <p>CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 
                    features.It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine.
                    CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many 
                    platforms, including Windows (since Python 3.9.1 version, Python "actively disallows installation on Windows 7";and did support 
                    Windows XP and older, with by now unsupported Python 2.7) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, 
                    since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[113] Platform portability was one of its earliest 
                    priorities,in Python 1 and 2 time-frame, even supporting OS/2 and Solaris;support has since been dropped for a lot of platforms.</p>
